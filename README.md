# My-Tetris
***

## Task
The task is to implement a classic Tetris game using only vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries except for Math). The game should adhere to the specified guidelines, including controls, piece colors, spawn locations, and game mechanics.

## Description
The problem is to create a functional and visually appealing Tetris game that accurately represents the traditional gameplay experience. The challenge lies in managing the game logic, rendering the pieces and the board, handling user inputs, and ensuring smooth gameplay with features like piece rotation, line clearing, and level progression.

To solve the problem, the game was implemented with a structured approach:
- An HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the game canvas and UI elements.
- A CSS file (`style.css`) styles the game and its components.
- A JavaScript file (`my_tetris.js`) contains the game logic, including piece movement, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, and rendering.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saminu3110c/My-Tetris.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd My-Tetris
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the game.

No additional installation steps or dependencies are required.

## Usage
To start and play the game:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the following controls to play the game:
    - **Left Arrow**: Move the piece left
    - **Right Arrow**: Move the piece right
    - **Down Arrow**: Soft drop the piece
    - **Up Arrow**: Rotate the piece clockwise
    - **Space**: Hard drop the piece
3. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
4. Press the "Pause" button to pause the game.

The objective of the game is to score points by clearing lines and progressing through levels without letting the pieces reach the top of the playfield.

Enjoy playing MyTetris!
